Running the head() function displays the first 6 rows of the data set.\n\n\nCode\nhead(railroad)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  state county               total_employees\n  <chr> <chr>                          <dbl>\n1 AE    APO                                2\n2 AK    ANCHORAGE                          7\n3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR               2\n4 AK    JUNEAU                             3\n5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA                  2\n6 AK    SITKA                              1\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndim(railroad)\n\n\n[1] 2930    3\n\n\nThe dim() functions shows us that the data set contains 2930 rows (2930 counties) and 3 columns (state, county, and total_employees).\nThe very first item lists a state code of “AE” and a county of “APO” with 2 employees for the year 2012. Since this is different from the state codes and county names that follow, I want to clarify that this is for overseas military. Besides “AE,” the other overseas military “state” abbreviations are AP and AA. Let’s check for all of these state codes in the data set.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter the state column through a vector of overseas military state codes\noverseas <- railroad %>% \n  filter(\n    state %in% c(\"AA\", \"AE\", \"AP\")\n  )\noverseas\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  state county total_employees\n  <chr> <chr>            <dbl>\n1 AE    APO                  2\n2 AP    APO                  1\n\n\nFiltering the original data set by states in a vector of military overseas abbreviations shows that only Armed Forces Europe (AE) and Armed Forces Pacific (AP) appear in this data set; Armed Forces the Americas (AA) does not.\n\n\nCode\n# How many unique values are in the state column?\nrailroad %>% \n  select(state) %>% \n  n_distinct(.)\n\n\n[1] 53\n\n\nSo apparently there are 53 unique values under the ‘state’ column. There’s 50 states, and the two overseas military codes we found before make 52. What’s the other one?\n\n\nCode\nunique(railroad$state)\n\n\n [1] \"AE\" \"AK\" \"AL\" \"AP\" \"AR\" \"AZ\" \"CA\" \"CO\" \"CT\" \"DC\" \"DE\" \"FL\" \"GA\" \"HI\" \"IA\"\n[16] \"ID\" \"IL\" \"IN\" \"KS\" \"KY\" \"LA\" \"MA\" \"MD\" \"ME\" \"MI\" \"MN\" \"MO\" \"MS\" \"MT\" \"NC\"\n[31] \"ND\" \"NE\" \"NH\" \"NJ\" \"NM\" \"NV\" \"NY\" \"OH\" \"OK\" \"OR\" \"PA\" \"RI\" \"SC\" \"SD\" \"TN\"\n[46] \"TX\" \"UT\" \"VA\" \"VT\" \"WA\" \"WI\" \"WV\" \"WY\"\n\n\nLooking through the unique listings of the ‘state’ column, we find ‘DC’ hiding in there, being sneaky and upping our “state” count to 53."

    "text": "Visualization\nWe can use a horizontal bar graph to show which areas had the most railroad employees in 2012. Because we know from the dim() function that this data set includes 2930 different counties, a bar graph of the number of state employees by county would be super long and overwhelming. So let’s instead opt to use employee counts by state instead of county. Using states will still give us a graph with 53 bars, so let’s add some color to distinguish consecutive bars from each other.\n\n\nCode\n# Access ggplot2 and set up a horizontal bar graph to display employees by state\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nst_emp_viz <- ggplot(railroad, aes(x=state, y=total_employees, fill=state)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Add a title as well as labels for the x- and y-axes\nst_emp_viz <- st_emp_viz + ggtitle(\"Railroad Employees by State (2012)\") + xlab(\"State\") + ylab(\"Total Employees\")\nst_emp_viz\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horizontal bar graph shows that the 3 states with the highest number of railroad employees in 2012 were Texas, Illinois, and New York, which all surpassed 15000 employees. Nebraska, California, and Pennsylvania have the next highest values, with all 3 states surpassing 12500."

At the county level, the highest number of railroad employees were based in Cook County, Illinois (8207); Tarrant County, Texas (4235); and Douglas County, Nebraska (3797). Considering the data set describes data from the year 2012 specifically, the data was likely gathered via local census."
